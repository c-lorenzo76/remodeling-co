10/15 <br>
I finished the front-end I just need to make some minor tweaks, but it should be fine. 
The thing I'm going to do is create a new email for noreplys. I have to fix the landing page
the text on mobile devices is almost going out of place. Then just finish the about page and
if I really want to add the map on the contact when the screen is lg.

Okay I managed to fix the inputOTP the way I was originally doing it was stupid. I also added a toast
for when they post the form. I'm going to start the other pages but this project is practically done. 
Just need to finish the backend.

I'm deadass pissed that the inputOTP shit isn't working. I'm going to just do it on a different page and test it. THen I'll implement it onto the page.

I finished the landing page but I now need to fix the form specifically for the 
phone input I'm getting some error. Plus I need to add types to the variables. I am getting errors 
when i pass it to the backend. I will fix those later. Oh and maybe use google cloud platform to put 
a map in the contact! Oh i also need to do something about the background in the navigation.tsx it makes 
my page extremely jittery whenever I scroll to there. Not smooth.

I finished the landing page just now need to add one more effect for the reviews
and I'm done and can focus on finishing the last pages for the website. I will apply a layout for each
page and then just focus on doing the backend. I also want to add a map for the contact info.

I almost finished the landing page haven't had too much time to dedicate 
towards it. The only thing that needs to be done would be cards for the services
and then just finish styling the contact component.

Didn't get to finish it by today but will probably be able to finish it by the end of the week. 
I almost finish the landing page. I'd like to just get rid of the shadow that the card left. 
Not sure how to get rid of it but will try again tomorrow.
