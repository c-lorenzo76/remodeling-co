I finished the landing page just now need to add one more effect for the reviews
and I'm done and can focus on finishing the last pages for the website. I will apply a layout for each
page and then just focus on doing the backend. I also want to add a map for the contact info.

I almost finished the landing page haven't had too much time to dedicate 
towards it. The only thing that needs to be done would be cards for the services
and then just finish styling the contact component.

Didn't get to finish it by today but will probably be able to finish it by the end of the week. 
I almost finish the landing page. I'd like to just get rid of the shadow that the card left. 
Not sure how to get rid of it but will try again tomorrow.
